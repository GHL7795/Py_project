Nowadays, “Image processing” is normally used by a wide 
range of applications and in different types of electronics 
like computers, digital cameras, mobile phones, etc. 
The image properties can be changed with the least investment 
such as contrast enhancement, borders detection, 
intensity measurement & apply different mathematical 
functions to enhance the imagery. Even though these methods 
can be very influential, the consumer frequently controls images, 
but understanding the fundamental values behind the effortless 
image processing routine is rare. This Python project cointains 
20 such image manipulation tasks which can be performed on 
images easily and quickly.
